# UnityPercentageObjectSpawner

Hey!

I have added a c# script called PercentageSpawner.cs, with it includes all you need to pick a random object for your need.

You can extent on the script itself if you like, but you can also pass it by reference to another script and just use the GetRandomObject() method.

Enjoy!
